    //Like basic rat but chonky!
    //Will pursue players within its relatively short sight range. When a player is out of range it creates a new patrol range starting from the position it lost sight of the player. Use majority logic of basic rat but add the health component.



    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
