public class ShieldCat : MonoBehaviour
{



    //This cat will begin idle and completely static. When a player enters its sight range it begins to move towards them slowly but then breaks into a fast charge in the direction of the player. 
    //This directional charge cannot be canceled unless the shield cat hits a wall or a player. When the shield cat hits a wall or player its facing direction changes and it has a cooldown before it can move again. 


    //If a player is hit by a charge deal massive damage.
